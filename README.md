# Azure Demand Forecasting & Capacity Optimization System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Azure Demand Forecasting & Capacity Optimization System** is a predictive analytics solution designed to forecast Azure Compute and Storage demand with high accuracy.  

The goal is to empower the Azure Supply Chain team to make data-driven capacity provisioning decisions, minimizing over-provisioning and under-provisioning of infrastructure resources.

By leveraging advanced data science, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques using Azure-based tools, this system aims to significantly improve forecasting accuracy and optimize infrastructure investment.
